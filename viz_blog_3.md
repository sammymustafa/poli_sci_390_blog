# Visualization Blog 3

For my final project, I wanted to study the efficiency of the green economy; by comparing countries' that are taking more or less political action to preserve, and protect the environment, it is possible to study whether or not there is an incentive to prioritizing our environment at the government level.

With this, I want to study: What are the benefits, if any, of green policies on countries' financial outcomes? 

I will study the level of environmental strives that countries are taking through indexes like the Environmental Performance Index (EPI), environmental taxes, and expenditure on environment protection from OECD databases as these incorporate various other factors into them to account for various factors of variability. On the other hand, I will look at finanical indicators within the VDEM dataset (from the background factors, economics section) but also try to extend the "outcomes" to see if any interesting variables are correlated with greater environmental preservation political actions. 

I hope to first visualize the best and worst countries by these environmental indexes. Then compare the economic factors between these countries. However, it would also be interesting to compare countries within the same regions and see how their strives and financial outcomes compare. Seeing if certain regions are more prone to or just simply more likely to perform better in terms of environmental preservation, economic position, or both would be interesting as well. 

The first inspiration I have for my project is a simple bar chart. I like its organization in descending order as well as the insertion of the GDP label that allows for easy comparison between the countries. The second inspirations is a "Sankey diagram" that highlights specific countries producing rare metals used in wind turbines and solar panels; I just like the flow of it as it doesn't even feel like it is presenting numerical data but it is. While this might be out of our realm, I hope to emulate something like this.
