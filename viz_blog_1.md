The controverisal topic I chose to study is the US minimum wage. With this, I sought out to see the changes, or lack of thereof, in the US minimum wage in relation to time.

The graphic below ([Yau, Flowing Data](https://flowingdata.com/2021/03/09/minimum-wage-and-cost-of-living/)) is one I really appreicate. While it only displays data from 2008 on, it does a really great job of visualizing so many different aspects of the controversey surrounding minimum wage: the federal minimum, state minimum, as well as the cost of living in each of these states. It is usually really hard to balance the large amount of state data into a presentable way, but I think they did a great job of establishing boundaries and defining what certain numbers and lines mean. Even better, this visualization is animated and shows the change with year, as well as demonstrating deviations from the center to a certain quadrant with different colors. Overall, this graphic makes a lot of data so easy to process

The next graphic ([Desjardins 2017](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/visualizing-real-value-u-s-minimum-wage/)) is one I did not like as much. First, I do not really like what the focus of the graph: the correlation between the nominal and 2020 inflation-considered minimum wage. While it does highlight that inflation has kept the minimum wage stagnant across the years, it is a bit hard to interpret this from the graph due to the up-and-down nature of the current minimum wage graph. In addition, the text above the graph take the focus away from this interpretation and seem to distract from the main goal of the graph.

Below is a graphic I developed from a dataset on Kaggle ([Conrady 2022](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/brandonconrady/us-minimum-wage-1938-2020)). I wanted to display the difference in the change of the minimum wage from both the federal and state level. The line demonstrates the change in the federal minimum wage while each point represents a state's minimum wage for that corresponding year. With this, I hoped to identify any trends surrounding whether or not a majority of US states try to stay below, at, or above the federal minimum wage. It seems like states are transitioning to either meeting or exceeding the federal minimum wage, but this is not considering the costs of living in these states. s
