In the political world, strives are made to prevent corruption from polluting various aspects of a country's government. One attempt to this includes making national elections free and fair for the people. One may think that this would allow for the people to elect high ranking officials that would uphold the country in a way they want, with low levels of corruption. However, this assumption cannot be made without studying the association between these variables. 

Thus, the Varieties of Democracy (V-Dem) dataset ([Coppedge et al., 2021](https://www.v-dem.net/static/website/img/refs/codebookv111.pdf)) was utilizied to study the association between the `v2elfrfair_osp` and `e_wbgi_cce` variables. The former variable (Pemstein et al., 2021) considers all the aspects of the pre-election, election, and post-election periods to index fairness throughout the process while the later variable (Kaufmann et al., 2016) is a World Bank governance indicator that measures the perception of various aspects of corruption, all defined as utilizing public power for private benefit. 

Thus, visualizating the correlation and trends underlying these two variables can reveal whether or not having free and fair elections is enough to produce countries with governments of low corruption.
